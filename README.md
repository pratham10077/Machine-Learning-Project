# Product Sales Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of product sales data. Using the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, and Kaggle for dataset sourcing, this project aims to derive meaningful insights from the sales data. The project is part of my internship with YBI Foundation, where I applied various data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize the data effectively.
